                        It would be impossible to describe the energy and excitement in the room
                        the first time Paul Reed Smith came to show off his beautiful guitars. Even
                        those among us who don't play could instantly recognize the quality craftsmanship
                        and astonishing beauty of these instruments.

                        PRS has only gotten better as they've expanded. Today,
                        whether you pick up an affordable SE electric, a Core series bass, a
                        top-of-the-line Private Stock acoustic, or any one of their astonishing amps,
                        you'll get a whole lot more than premium performance — you'll get a true work
                        of art.

                        While PRS is best known for their electric guitars, over
                        the past decade they've branched out in exciting new directions, such as basses
                        and acoustics. Their acoustic guitars generally divide into the single-cut Angelus
                        line and the no-cut Tonare.

                        SE acoustic models feature Sitka spruce tops on ovangkol or maple
                        bodies, plus Fishman F1 electronics, but when you go into the Private Stock collection,
                        these instruments include jaw-dropping creations featuring figured koa, Brazilian rosewood,
                        and inlays that rival the finest acoustics ever made.

                        Combined with special bracing and construction methods, these acoustic-electric
                        models offer the same performance Sweetwater guitarists expect from PRS's electric guitars.

                        PRS’s Maryland electric guitar production switched over to a new proprietary
                        lineup of Signature Series strings, complementing the existing classic series strings which were
                        used on PRS Guitars for more than 30 years. Signature Series strings feature a reformulated alloy
                        for louder and brighter tone as well as soldered ends for extended string life and durability.

                <div class="article__text">
                    <p class="article__p">
                        Paul Reed Smith was born to build beautiful instruments, spending countless hours developing
                        his skills in childhood and building his first electric guitar (infamously carved from a solid-core door) in college.
                        His first break came when he sold guitars backstage at rock shows, and among his earliest adopters was Carlos Santana.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__p">
                        Paul Reed Smith was inducted into Vintage Guitar Magazine’s prestigious Hall of Fame,
                        joining past inductees Leo Fender, Les Paul, and Ted McCarty. Vintage Guitar publisher Alan Greenwood noted,
                        “Paul is the first of his generation of guitar builders to be inducted to the Vintage Guitar Hall of Fame,
                        his entry marks a changing of the guard.”

                <div class="article__text line">
                    <p class="article__p">
                        After a lengthy R&D process, the S2 Series was introduced in 2013 and aimed to fill the gap between PRS’ affordable
                        line of SE instruments and the renowned US core line. The American-made line of guitars has grown from three instruments
                        to more than a dozen and caters to a new breed of player.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__p">
                        Similar to the SE series, the PRS S2 line fulfills Paul's desire to accommodate another level of guitarist. In this case,
                        the made-in-Maryland S2 line balances the cost of economy designs with the stock benefits of the Core series. Specifically,
                        S2 models, which include the unique designs and versions of the most popular PRS Core models, offer sleek contours and upgraded
                        hardware, with select high-performance electronics and traditional PRS appointments.

                        PRS offers exquisite Private Stock creations for guitarists who want the very best instruments money can buy. These instruments begin
                        in the PRS Custom Shop, where the company's top luthiers handbuild unique made-to-order and limited-edition instruments like no others on the market.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__p">
                        Each instrument is based on a Core model and customized with select details, such as Artist tops (a step above even PRS's 10-Tops), nonstandard finishes,
                        upgraded hardware and electronics, and more. They're so unique that PRS even numbers each Private Stock guitar to distinguish it from all others.
